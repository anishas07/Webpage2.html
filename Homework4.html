        <h1> NORWOOD INTERNATION HIGH SCHOOL</h1>
        <P> Meet our Principal
        I am delighted to welcome you to the Norwood International High School website.
        ​Over the past two years Norwood International High School has undertaken a significant and exciting transformation. Not
        only have we co-located onto one site, introduced Year 7 students, expanded our internationalised curriculum and created
        stunning new learning spaces. We have even changed our name to reflect our new location and, most importantly, our
        global outlook and our commitment to international mindedness in all its forms.
        
        ​Norwood International High School is truly enjoying a new beginning with a successful past and exciting future.
        
        Our school community is committed to upholding our celebrated traditions and developing engaged global citizens who can
        make a positive difference in this fast-changing world. In the middle years our year 7-9 students undertake the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme, a fantastic
        program that encourages students to become curious, caring and insightful learners. Middle school learners are supported <mark>
        to connect, collaborate and create by a small team of dedicated teachers with their learning community in our new
        purpose-built middle school.</mark>
        
        Senior students in years 10-12 may study either the <m>South Australian Certificate of Education </m>(SACE) or the <small>
        International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. </small> These learners choose from extensive curriculum offerings catering for a
        range of preferred pathways, interests and specialisation. They have access to outstanding specialist facilities, as
        well as unique study and <em>meeting spaces</em>, that promote both independent and authentic learning experiences.
        ​
        <h3> Learning also extends beyond the classroom with a huge <s>array </s> of co-curricular opportunities. In fact, we offer something
        for everyone, whether it be lunchtime clubs, sports teams, music ensembles and bands, rowing, pedal prix, school
        musicals, debating, and service-learning initiatives.</h3>
        
        <del>A key feature of our school  </del>is the way we value and celebrate diversity.Students from a wide range of cultural and
        linguistic backgrounds respect and learn from each other. 
        Regardless of what your passion, talents and career aspirations may be, you can find your special place at Norwood
       <mark>"</sup> International High School – a place to grow, learn and discover! <sup> "</sup> </mark><sup>
